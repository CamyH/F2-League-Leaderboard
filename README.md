# F2 League Leaderboard
### This Python program was created by myself in order for me and my three friends to keep track of the following things throughout our F2 League within the F1 2020 official game:
* Our total points
* How many wins of each type we have
* How many pole positions each of us have
* How many fastest laps each of us have

### We have modified one rule and that is no matter what position you finish in, if you have the fastest lap, you are still awarded the 2 extra points.

#### It outputs the results table to a .csv file which is ordered in descending points order 
##### Requires Python 3.6 or later
